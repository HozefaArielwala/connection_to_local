1. `git init` - Powers your folder to be managed by git and initializes the new empty repository.It also creates a .git folder thats has all the relevant logic to manage the versions of your project
2. `Working area` --> There can be bunch of files that are not currently handled by git. It means that changes done or to be done in those files are not managed by git yet.A file which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area.
when we do git status and we see a bunch of untracked files then these are actually called to be in a working area.
3. `Staging area` --> What all files are going to be part of the next version that we will create . This staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version to the next version.
